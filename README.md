# Customer Banking Challenge
Challenge 3 - Customer Banking Challenge

## Project Overview and Origin
The goal of this project was to create a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

### Programming Language
Python programming language was used to create the code for this project in Visual Studio Code.

### Data Validation 

To ensure that the customer banking program ran as intended, data validation tools were implemented. Specifically, the code was designed to ensure that the customer input valid menu options and if invalid input was entered, the code was written to produce error messages advising the customer to enter valid input.

**_Valid Balance Inputs_**: The code was written to produce an error code if the customer did not enter a valid number for the savings and CD account balances.

**_Valid Interest Rates_**: If the customer did not input a valid response for the interest rates on the savings and CD accounts, the code was set to default to generate an error message.

**_Valid Maturity Duration_**: If the customer did not input a valid response for the maturity duration for the savings and CD accounts, the code was set to default to generate an error message.

## Resources 
I received assistance with importing the starter files into the terminal as I initially tried importing the files individually rather than as an entire folder for the challenge.
